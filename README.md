## Code Fellows CanvasApp MVP

###### []()

Define the MVP

#### []()Background:

- According to Code Fellows staff
	there is room to improve the student selection process. 
- The selection process begins with
	students first asking if and how they are qualified with their
	current coding skills, or lack of coding skills. 
- Beyond Code Fellows periodic public info sessions and general
	email for questions, there is not a solid way for potential students
	to know if they are qualified to join Code Fellows and in which
	program to begin their coding path. The teachers would also like to
	track this progress. 

#### []()Objectives:

- We want to know how teachers currently inform/advise
	potential students. 

#### []()Hypothesis:

- Students and teachers would appreciate a method in which
	students could answer the question themselves as to whether they are
	Code Fellows eligible or not, and where to start. 
	 

#### []()Methods:

- Email a set of questions to Code
	Fellows staff and teachers: 
- What common questions do potential
	students ask you prior to applying? 

- What process do
	you currently utilize to know if a student is qualified to join Code
	Fellows? 
- How do you
	determine in which foundations track or accelerator a student should
	begin? 
- Are there any
	typical issues that arise after advising a student? 
- What ideas can
	you give us to make this app useful for Code Fellows staff and
	students? 
- Is this a good
	idea? Better ideas....? 

#### []()Reaching
our MVP

- Who: Potential Code Fellow
	Students and Teachers 
- What: To inform potential students
	as to if/how they are qualified to join Code Fellows 
- Where: Web browser 
	 
- When: Those who have an interest
	in Code Fellows 
- Why: To give a useful method for
	teachers and students to find the above information 
- How: Web/Mobile app 

#### []()MVP

Based on the sources we've researched (see #Sources) and Code
Fellows Teacher questionnaire, our minimal viable product is
achievable and useful. Current teacher advising processes are not
properly scoped and rigid.

Teacher's support the idea of a new method to advise students. We
will start by completing this MVP, creating a user-flow, wire frame
and back-end scaffolding.
